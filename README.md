# ESP32_Vibration_GUI
### Project Plan: Two-Week Breakdown

#### **Week 1: Basic Setup and Testing Communication**

**Objective**: 
- Establish communication between the ESP32 and the demo UI.
- Set up a basic framework to send and receive sensor data between the ESP32 and the UI.

**Key Tasks**:
1. **ESP32 Setup**:
   - Write or verify the ESP32 firmware to gather sensor data (e.g., from accelerometer, temperature sensors, etc.).
   - Ensure that the ESP32 sends sensor data over serial communication in a format (JSON, CSV, etc.) that the UI can understand.
   - Test the sensor data locally on the ESP32 (via serial monitor) to ensure it's being collected and sent properly.

2. **Python UI Setup**:
   - Create a basic Python UI using **Tkinter** (or other framework) to connect to the ESP32.
   - Implement a serial connection interface to select a port and connect to the ESP32.
   - Display basic sensor data (e.g., AX, AY, AZ values, and temperature) on the UI once connected.

3. **Sensor Data Transmission**:
   - Ensure the ESP32 is sending sensor data at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to the UI via serial communication.
   - Implement the receiving logic on the Python UI to process and display the sensor data.
   
4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test the communication from both ends:
     - **ESP32**: Ensure sensor data is transmitted correctly.
     - **Python UI**: Ensure data is received and displayed correctly.
   - Handle possible errors such as timeout, invalid data formats, or connection issues.

5. **Demonstration**:
   - Create a simple demo that shows the sensor data on the UI, demonstrating the ability to receive data from the ESP32 in real-time.
   - Include basic error handling, such as displaying a message if no data is received from the ESP32.

**End of Week 1 Goal**: 
- The system should be capable of sending sensor data from the ESP32 to the Python UI and displaying it on a simple demo interface.

#### **Week 2: UI Improvements, Settings Management, and Testing**

**Objective**: 
- Expand the UI to include settings configuration and improve communication with the ESP32.
- Test and refine the data flow between the ESP32 and the Python UI.

**Key Tasks**:
1. **Enhance the Python UI**:
   - Create tabs in the UI for managing different settings (e.g., **Settings Tab** for device configurations).
   - Implement fields for **device name**, **MQTT settings**, and **sensor configurations**.
   - Allow users to modify certain settings (e.g., MQTT server address, sensor thresholds) directly via the UI.
   
2. **Handle Serial Communication for Settings**:
   - Enable the Python UI to send settings commands (like updating device name or MQTT server address) back to the ESP32.
   - Modify the ESP32 firmware to handle incoming commands (e.g., saving device configurations or switching sensor modes).
   
3. **Sensor Data Visualization**:
   - Implement real-time graphs or charts (using `matplotlib` or `tkinter` canvas) to visualize the sensor data dynamically.
   - Display data trends or alerts (e.g., if sensor values exceed predefined thresholds).
   
4. **Implement Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Improve error handling in both the ESP32 code and Python UI. Log any issues with data transmission, connection errors, or invalid settings.
   - Display clear error messages on the UI when communication fails or settings are not applied correctly.
   
5. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Perform end-to-end testing of the entire system:
     - Verify that settings sent from the UI are properly received and processed by the ESP32.
     - Ensure that sensor data can be sent and displayed in real-time, even with frequent updates.
   - Test the system under different conditions (e.g., connection drops, invalid sensor data) to ensure robustness.

6. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Add a **"Save Settings"** button to store configurations persistently (using EEPROM on the ESP32).
   - Allow for easy refresh of sensor data and settings through the UI.
   
**End of Week 2 Goal**:
- The system should be fully functional with the following capabilities:
  - Real-time sensor data display.
  - Settings configuration interface.
  - Ability to send/receive settings and sensor data between the ESP32 and the Python UI.
  - Error handling and logging for smooth operation.

### Summary of Goals:
- **Week 1**: Establish basic serial communication, send and display sensor data from the ESP32 to the Python UI.
- **Week 2**: Add settings management functionality, improve UI with graphs and real-time data, and refine error handling and testing.

This timeline allows you to make incremental progress while testing each part of the system and ensuring the functionality is as expected. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific task!
